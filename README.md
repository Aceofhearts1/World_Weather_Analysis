# World_Weather_Analysis
## Explanation
The goal was randomly come up with an enormous number of random points on that map. Through that, we would find the closest cities and figure out the weather in all of those cities at the given moment. From the, as if we were looking for a vacation spot, we found the closest hotels to each point. Through APIs, we added directions and detailed markers for ourselves. You can think of it like spinning a globe and placing your finger on a spot and essentially gaining all the info you need to go there.

Before getting the the directions, I did some graphing to show the relationship between the data we collected through APIs. Specifically a weather-related one.

1. I showed that heat and latitude are related. (Obviously but it doesn't hurt to show the data to prove it) 
2. I showed that latitude and wind speed have no correlation.
3. I showed that latitude and cloudiness have no correlation.
4. I showed that humidity and latitude don't have a strong correlation during the summer.
